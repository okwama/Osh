Cursor Agent Rules for Flutter + GetX + Direct DB
=============================

1. Stay on task  
   - Never deviate from the assigned task unless explicitly instructed.

2. Announce planned actions before execution  
   - Clearly state what will be done and why — before taking action.

3. Respect the existing folder tree  
   - Always place files in the correct folders. Do not create new folders arbitrarily.

4. Check for existing functions before creating new ones  
   - Search the codebase to avoid redundant implementations.

5. Use the correct architecture layers  
   - Controllers = logic  
   - Services = DB and backend calls  
   - Views = UI only (no logic)

6. Avoid assumptions  
   - If unclear, pause and ask instead of guessing.

7. Log all major steps  
   - Include intent, key actions, and any SQL queries or updates.

8. Break down large tasks  
   - List all steps first, then execute step by step with progress confirmation.

9. Never continue silently after an error  
   - Report all failures immediately with details. Stop unless instructed to retry.

10. Summarize progress  
    - After each phase, give a quick update: what’s done, what’s next, and ask for confirmation.
